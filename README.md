## rich-MultiTrip-MultiModal-VRP

### Some Problem Features:
- Minimization of the Maximum Vehicle's Route Duration is considered
- Multiple diverse types of functional vertices enrich the problem further
- For the first time, the synchronization of transhipment across multiple modes is considered

### This Repository is for hosting the Computational Datasets of the Paper submission. Please refer to it's pre-print DOI: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13227

### Subsequently, after acceptance of the paper, the codes will be released by making this connected private repository public: https://github.com/SanTanBan/Cascaded_richVRP_with_WaitingTimes_at_TPs
