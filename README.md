## rich-MultiTrip-MultiModal-VRP

Check back by end of this week...

### Some Problem Features:
1. Minimization of the Maximum Vehicle's Route Duration is considered
2. Multiple diverse types of functional vertices enrich the problem further

### This Repository is for hosting the Computational Datasets of the Paper submission. Please refer to it's pre-print DOI: 

### Subsequently, after acceptance of the paper, the codes will be released by making this connected private repository public: https://github.com/SanTanBan/Cascaded_richVRP_with_WaitingTimes_at_TPs
